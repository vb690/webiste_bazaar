This naming, that we borrow from the various deep learning framework around, might not be the optimal one as we won’t necessarely need or have a complementary “backward” function but it is functional to the needs of this tutorial.\nLet’s look at how the forward functiona for a simple linear model might look like\n\n@jit\ndef forward(X, current_state):\n    \"\"\"Perform the forward computations for a linear model\n\n    Args:\n        x: covaruates of the model.\n        current_state: current state of the model, containing \n        parameters and state for the pseudo random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n        yhat: estimate of the target variable.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_params, random_state = current_state\n    beta = current_params[\"beta\"]\n    alphas = current_params[\"alphas\"]\n    yhat =  beta + jnp.dot(X, alphas)\n    return yhat\n\nHere, forward receive as input some data x and a variable we call current_state, as we see this last one it then gets unpacked in some current_parameters and a random_state. The idea here is that we are passing around the current state of the model (parameters or random number generator seed) instead of accessing it as we would with the attributes of a class.\nOnce unpacked all the necessary variables (here random state is spurious, but we could use it in case we need some stochastic behaviour from our function), the forward function simply execute all the logic necessary for mapping the input x to an estimate of our target variable yhat.\nOnce we obtain an estimate of our target variable, we should evaluate it with rispect to a given objective function, let’s see how we can do that with the compute_loss function."

This utility function provided by jax allows us to traverse an antire PyTree in order to get all its leaves values, let’s see an example in action\n\ncomplex_nested_pytree = {\n    \"a\": (1, 2, 3),\n    \"b\": 4,\n    \"c\": {\n        \"c_1\": 5,\n        \"c_2\": 6,\n        \"c_3\": {\n            \"c_3_1\": 7,\n            \"c_3_2\": 8,\n            \"c_3_3\": 9\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ntree_leaves(complex_nested_pytree)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nAs you can see, this can become a convenient way for flattenting even the most intricate tree structure (such as those we have when specifying the parameters of a complex model)."

    "text": "2.2 Measurements and Predictions\nA more common situation however is observed sequential measurements from a single, potentially noisy sensor. Of course the more measurements we take the closer we should get to the actual state of the phenomena we are analyzing.\nUnfortunately in many situations we don’t have this luxury. As we mentioned at the beginning of this post, in some situation we can only observe a handful of measurements (potentially only one!) like in the case of temporal series.\nIn a temporal series if our measurements happen to be at a frequency higher than the dynamics of the phenomena under investigation we are in a relatively comfortable position but otherwise we are going to be in a situation where information is sparse and vulnerable to noise.\n\nmeasurements = np.array([50, 60, 48, 49, 46, 42, 40])\n\nfig, ax = time_series_plots(\n    measurements=measurements,\n    expected_noise=5\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we were to use the same heuristics illustrated before, a jump of ~10 units between Time 0, Time 1 and Time 2 would be compatible with the observed measurements and their associated error bounds.\nDepending on the nature of the phenomena under investigation this might or might not be plausible. In order to verify this we need to “blend” the measurements provided by our noisy sensor with a model of the dynamics controlling our phenomena. Let’s start with a very naive model.\n\nfig, ax = time_series_plots(\n    measurements=measurements,\n    expected_noise=5\n)\nax.plot(\n    np.arange(len(measurements)),\n    [50] * len(measurements),\n    linestyle=\":\",\n    color=\"k\",\n    label=\"Constant Dynamics\"\n)\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we assume that the state underlying our phenomena stays constant over time, hence producing virtually no variations in the observed measurements.\nWe can already see how this, despite its simplicity, is already informing us that, under the assumptions of our model, the measurement at Time 1 is likely to be driven by noise.\n\nHeads Up\nIt is important to remember that the word noise doesn’t necessary indicate the presence of an error. It rather represents variations that are not consistent with our model or that cannot be explained by the information we have at hand.\n\nThat said, we can also clearly see how the assumptions of a constant dynamics model do not get along well with the available measurements, which seems to be characterized by a downward trend. So maybe let’s try to draw the gradient line connecting the first to the last measurement\n\ndef slope_model(beta, alpha, time):\n    \"\"\"Generate predictions according to a \n    simple linear model.\n\n    Args:\n        - beta(float): intercept value.\n        - alpha(float): slope value.\n        - time(np.array): time points.\n    \n    Returns:\n        - predictions (np.array): predictions generated by\n        the model.\n    \"\"\"\n    return beta + alpha * time\n\nnegative_slope_model = slope_model(\n    beta=50, \n    alpha=-1.7, \n    time=np.arange(len(measurements))\n)\n\nfig, ax = time_series_plots(\n    measurements=measurements,\n    expected_noise=5\n)\nax.plot(\n    np.arange(len(measurements)),\n    negative_slope_model,\n    linestyle=\":\",\n    color=\"k\",\n    label=\"Negative Slope Dynamics\"\n)\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough far from being perfect, this new model appears to provide a much better fit to our measurements. It is compatible with most of them or at least lies within the acceptable region defined by their error bounds. On top of that, having a model allows us to perform predictions about future measurements that we can then confront with actual observed values.\nHowever, we can see that the predictions from our negative slope model are not incompatible with the measurement provided at Time 1, what should we do in this case then? Should we simply disregard it? At the end of the day the model is just an artificial device plucked out of thin air (well, not exactly as it should be informed by our knowledge of the dynamics at play) while the measurement is the manifestation of real events.

The g and h are the scaling factors that we introduced in our function, namely the scale_factor (weighting the contribution of the the observed measurements) and the gain_factor (scaling the change in state estimate over time).\n\nTake Home Message\nThe key points underlying the algorithm summarize what we highlighted until here\n\nMore data points are better than less\nNo data must be thrown away, no information must be discarded.\nThe middle point between two value can give a more accurate estimate.\nMeasurement will be predicted along with rate of change based on current state estimate and how much change we will expect in the future.\nThe new estimate will be generated as a middle point between measurement and estimated state, giving more weight to the more accurate of the two.\n\n\nWhat is the target of our estimation efforts is what is called the system. We can think of it as the data generating process, for example given a time series of GDP for a nation the system might be the economy of that nation. The state is the current configuration of the system at a given point in time, for example the estimated GDP for the year 2008, it is usually hidden to us. The measurements are quantitative description of the state of the system, they are often noisy so they might not coincide with the state, we can think of them as observable manifestations of the state.\n\nTake Home Message\nAs in eny estimation problem, the aim of a filtering algorithm is to form estimates of the hidden state of the system given some observable information.\n\nIn order to generate our estimate we need to alternate between a prediction step and an update step.\nIn the prediction step we use a process model (in our case was the slope_model) for mathematically describing how the system evolves, this model is used for propagating the state of the system into the future.

Well this is problem dependent but it can be informed by the effect that these two parameters have on the estimate\n\nstate_factor (g): as this parameter gets larger we will tend to more closely follow (i.e. we will weight more) the measurement. A value too high will lead us to over-fit to the noise while a value too low will force us to ignore important information about changes in the system dynamics.\ngain_factor (h): as this parameter gets larger we will tend to react more quickly to sudden changes in the dynamics underlying our measurements. A value too high might cause to over-react producing spurious high-frequency spikes in the estimate while a value too low might cause the signal to adapt very slowly to sudden changes in the measurements (i.e., the estimate will take a long time to correct itself)."

For doing so, we can draw two distinct samples (the A and B group) from a population of interest, subject one of the two to the intervention and then measure observed differences in the outcome variable. Subject to several assumptions and pre-conditions (we suggest reading part V of “Regression and Other Stories” (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2021)), if we observe a difference between the two groups when can conclude that our intervention might have had an impact on our outcome variable."

We can think of it as a stochastic process where any point drawn from it, \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\), comes from a multi-dimensional gaussian. In other words, it is as a prior distribution over an un-known function \\(\\mu(x)\\) defined as\n\\[\n\\mu(x_1), \\dots, \\mu(x_n) \\sim \\mathcal{N}((m(x_1), \\dots, m(x_n)), k(x, \\dots, x_n))\n\\]\nor more compactly\n\\[\n\\mu(X) \\sim GP(m, k)\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is a mean function and \\(k\\) is a covariance function. We can already have an intuition of how defining the \\(GP\\) in terms mean and covariance functions gives us quite some flexibility as it allows us to produce a model than can interpolate for all the value of \\(x\\).\nThe \\(m\\) function provides the most likely guess for the \\(GP\\) like the mean vector of a multi-dimensional Gaussian, deviation from this expected model are then handled by the covariance function \\(k\\).\nThe \\(k\\) function (often called Kernel) allows to structurally define the \\(GP\\) behavior at any two points by producing an \\(n \\times n\\) covariance function given by evaluating \\(k(x, x')\\) for every \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\).\nOne convenient property of \\(GP\\) is that the sum and multiplication of two or more \\(GP\\) is itself a \\(GP\\), this allows to combine different types of Kernels for imposing specific structural constrains."

    "text": "0.1 Hypotheses to be investigated\nThe analysis does not have specific hypotheses to investigate but rather poses some challenges that needs to be overcome while trying to perform the estimation tasks. Here an overview of said challenges:\n\nIn order to estimate the level of risk for a certain county in the U.S. we first needed to obtain a reliable estimate of the probability of an extreme hail event to occur in a given county.\nDue to the nature of extreme hail events, calculating their probability cannot be done by simply evaluating the observed frequency of such events but requires to leverage specific statistical frameworks (e.g., Extreme Value Theory) (i.e., EVA) than can provide long term likelihood for such events (e.g., 100s of years.)\nIn order to obtain reliable estimates, EVA usually requires that a sufficiently large number of events have been observed. Unfortunately increasing the level of granularity (i.e., looking at county level) forces to work with small samples. Moreover, this challenge is even more pronounced in those states where the Extreme Hail Events are more rare which are also states where a correct risk assessment is more critical."

This dataset contains records that documents:\n\nThe occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena.\nRare, unusual, weather phenomena\nOther significant meteorological events\n\nA common characteristic of these events is being so intense or exceptional so to cause potential damage to people, structure and causing disruption to commerce. The database contains data from 1950 until 2024. However due to changes in the record, measurement and collection strategy the portion containing detailed and reliable information is limited to the interval 1996 - 2024. This is also the portion of the dataset that we have used for our analyses.\n\n\n1.1.2 Counties Geometry Dataset\nIn order to to map and visualize our analysis onto the U.S. territory (and counties in particular) we obtained a geo-dataframe containing geometry files for each state in the U.S. This dataset was not used just for visualization purposes but it also played an important role in the estimation of extreme hail events at county level (more details will be given in section Section 1.5.1.)"

Due to space constrains we will report here only the results for the state of Florida.\nThe state of Florida perfectly illustrates the challenges of estimating extreme hail events in liminal situations: in states like California and Texas the risk assessment becomes easier due to either the complete absence or the abundance of hail events.

Figure 2 shows the percentiles for both hail size and hail events across counties. Darker colors indicate higher hail size and number of hail events.\nVery large hail events are very rare and exceptionally large hail events are even more rare.\nVery large hail events can occur even in areas where hail per-se is a very rare event. Figure 2 shows three different type of percentile values of hail size for the different counties: 50%, 95% and 99% as we can see some of the most extreme values occur in area where there has been very few hail events.\nWe can notice that there is spatial coherence in how the hail events distribute on the territory of Florida (possibly reflecting geographical characteristics of the various areas)\n\n\npartialized_plot_comparison_quantile_hail_time = partial(\n    plot_comparison_quantile_hail_time,\n    y=COUNT_TARGET,\n    modelling_df=count_state_modelling_df[\n        count_state_modelling_df[\"number_events\"] &gt; 0\n    ],\n    states=SELECTED_ANALYSIS_STATES,\n    linewidth=3,\n    solid_capstyle='round'\n)\nquantiles = [25, 75, 95, 99]\nframes = [partialized_plot_comparison_quantile_hail_time(quantile=quantile, color=COLORMAP(index + 1)) for index, quantile in enumerate(quantiles)]\ngif.save(frames, Path(GIFS_PATH, 'temporal_quantiles.gif').as_posix(), duration=1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Observed Temporal Quantiles\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 3 we can also observe the presence of seasonal patterns and trending behaviour that changes when considering different quantiles for both hail sizes and number of hail events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Comparing Daily Empirical Probability of Hail Events by Magnitude\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows in more detail how the more an event is severe, in terms of hail size (i.e., disruptive), the lower is its daily probability of occurring. I particular we can see the sharp drop from moderate (1.25” to 1.75”) to severe (greater than 1.77”) hail storm.\nWhat this tells us is that hail storms, in particular those which have potential of being disruptive or dangerous, are better framed in terms of extreme events. In the next section we will see how these events require to be treated with particular care.\n\n\n1.2.3 Visualizing The characteristics of Extreme Hail Events\nWe now want to have a better understanding of the statistical characteristics of hail events which are extreme in size, meaning they are above 1.77”\n\nfig, ax, sub_ax = plot_hail_distribution_with_tails(\n    magnitude_events=continuous_state_modelling_df[CONTINUOUS_TARGET].values,\n    state=SELECTED_ANALYSIS_STATES[0],\n)\nplt.savefig(Path(IMAGES_PATH, \"events_distribution.png\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Visualizing the Distribution of Hail Events\n\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the distribution of the hail events with a red line indicating the critical value of 1.77”. We can observe a series of characteristics typical of hail events:\n\nMost of the mass of the distribution lies around the 1” mark indicating that the most common hail events are usually innocuous. We need to note that from Figure 5 we removed all the days in which there were no hail events. If not we would have observed the typical pattern of a zero-inflated distribution.\nThe distribution is left skewed with a relatively long and heavy right tail. This indicates that hail event of disruptive force can appear with a non-negligible probability but are in general very rare.\nFocusing on the extreme hail events (i.e., above the 1.77” mark) we can see the distribution is again heavily skewed on the left suggesting that truly disastrous hail events (i.e., size above the 2.5”) can be very hard to predict."

In particular we followed this tutorial on extreme events provided by course on computational tools in climate science.\nExtreme Value Analysis (EVA) usually has the aim of estimating, giving a sample of data, the probability (i.e., risk) associated with an event that is extreme in nature. For doing so it usually require three steps:\n\nIndividuating the extremes in a given period of time with a given time resolution (it usually boils down to be the annual extremes).\nFit an appropriated statistical distribution to the extreme data.\nEstimate the probability of potentially unseen extreme events using the parameters of the distribution.\n\n\n1.4.1 Individuating the “Extremes”\nIn order to individuate the extreme in our data we have two options:\n\nBlock Maxima (i.e., BM): selecting the maximum value ove a “block of time” (e.g. a year).\nPeak Over Threshold (i.e., POT): selecting all the values higher than a given threshold.\n\nBoth options have their advantages and dis-advantages. We won’t go into details and just say that we select BM mostly for convenience as it is the methodology that retains most of the data (which is already scarce in our situation). More information can be found in this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Example of Bock Maxima\n\n\n\nIn Figure 6 we can see how the maximum monthly hail sizes get converted in maximum annual hail sizes by applying a block maxima of size 12 months. One of the major advantages of block maxima is that of partially removing the issue of autocorrelation and seasonality as we take exactly one value for each year.\n\n\n1.4.2 Fitting the Appropriated Distribution\nOnce we have obtained our samples of extreme values and did all that is in our power to ensure that they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) we can proceed at fitting a distribution to the samples. Which distribution is more suitable depends on the characteristics of the events we are are tying to model.\nIn the case of extreme events what we are dealing with are tail events better described by skewed distributions with a fat tail. There are 3 types of distribution that are well suited for this: Gumbell, Weibull and Frechet which can be flexibly represented by a single 3 parameters distribution the Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV).\nThe Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the GEV is defined as:\n\\[\nH(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n[1 + \\xi(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma})]^{1/ \\xi} ,& \\text{if } \\xi\\neq 0 \\\\\ne^{-(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma})} ,& \\text{if } \\xi = 0 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\mu\\) being the location parameter (which controls the center of the distribution), \\(\\sigma\\) being the scale parameter (controlling the spread of the distribution) and \\(\\xi\\) being the shape parameter (which controls the behavior in the tails of the distribution). The CDF will become important later on when we will try to convert the probability associated with a given extreme value in a return period.\nThere are some important statistical reasons for choosing the GEV distribution for modelling annual maxima of hail events, but in our case we can see this more clearly by looking at Figure 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparing Gaussian and GenExtreme Fit\n\n\n\nThe figure show both a Gaussian and a GEV fit to annual maxima for hail sizes. Other than the sub-optimal fit for the Gaussian distribution we can see how the tails in particular (where most problematic and truly extreme events concentrate) are heavily discounted.\n\n\n1.4.3 Estimating the probability and return period for any extreme value\nOnce we have obtained the parameters of the GEV distribution it is possible to estimate the probability of a new, potentially unseen, hail event as large as a critical value c as simply \\(p(event &lt;= c | \\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)\\) with \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\xi\\) being estimated parameters. Of course the probability of observing an event as large or larger then a critical value c is simply given by \\(1 - p\\).\nIt is also possible to convert this probability value in what is called a “return period” which indicate that on average how much time can pass between an events of certain magnitude or greater. This value is obtained by\n\\[\nT = \\frac{1}{1 - p}\n\\]\nGiven that in our case the time resolution of our extreme events is yearly, we can define each critical value as a “T years event” which indicates that every year there is a \\(1-p\\) of observing an event as large or larger then the critical value. For example a “100 years event” indicate a probability of 0.01 of observing said event in a given year.\nLet’s see how our EVA approach perform at the state level\n\naggregated_eva_state_modelling = (\n    eva_state_modelling_df.groupby(eva_state_modelling_df[\"begin_date_time\"].dt.year)[\n        CONTINUOUS_TARGET\n    ]\n    .max()\n    .reset_index()\n)\nreturns = compute_empirical_return_periods(\n    aggregated_eva_state_modelling[CONTINUOUS_TARGET].values\n)\n\nplt.scatter(\n    returns,\n    aggregated_eva_state_modelling[CONTINUOUS_TARGET].values,\n    s=80,\n    facecolors=\"none\",\n    edgecolors=\"k\",\n    label=\"Empirical Values\",\n)\nplt.plot(\n    np.arange(1, 150),\n    compute_mle_return_periods_scipy(\n        aggregated_eva_state_modelling[CONTINUOUS_TARGET],\n        max_years=150,\n        min_years=1,\n    ),\n    c=COLORMAP(5),\n    linewidth=2,\n)\nplt.grid(alpha=0.5)\nplt.title(f\"Return Periods\\n{SINGLE_STATE[0].capitalize()}\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Hail Size\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Years\")\nplt.axvline(100, linestyle=\"-.\", c=\"r\", label=\"100 Years Event\")\nplt.axhline(\n    CRITICAL_VALUE_CONTINUOUS_TARGET, linestyle=\":\", c=\"r\", label='1.7\" Hail Event'\n)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin this case we used scipy’s genextreme distribution instead of the library pyextreme. We see how the estimated return periods fit nicely with the empirical values.\nEstimating return periods at the state level is not very useful as:\n\nUS states are rather big.\nOver an entire state it is very likely that we will have at least one very large hail event per year. Therefore we might be overestimating the actual county-level risk profile.\n\nWe can perform the same type of analysis using county level data\n\n\nShow supplementary code\nmodels = {\n    \"empirical\": {},\n    \"MLE_scipy\": {},\n    \"MLE_pyextreme\": {},\n}\ncounty_names = eva_state_modelling_df[\"county\"].unique()\nfor county in tqdm(county_names):\n\n    hail_events_extremes = eva_state_modelling_df[\n        eva_state_modelling_df[\"county\"] == county\n    ][CONTINUOUS_TARGET].values\n    time_index = eva_state_modelling_df[eva_state_modelling_df[\"county\"] == county][\n        TIME_COLUMN\n    ].values\n\n    return_value, model = compute_mle_return_periods_pyextremes(\n        hail_events_extremes=pd.Series(data=hail_events_extremes, index=time_index),\n    )\n\n    models[\"empirical\"][county] = {\n        \"period\": compute_empirical_return_periods(\n            hail_events_extremes=hail_events_extremes,\n        ),\n        \"magnitude\": hail_events_extremes,\n    }\n\n    models[\"MLE_scipy\"][county] = {\n        \"period\": np.arange(2, 150),\n        \"magnitude\": compute_mle_return_periods_scipy(\n            hail_events_extremes=hail_events_extremes,\n        ),\n    }\n    models[\"MLE_pyextreme\"][county] = {\n        \"period\": np.arange(2, 150),\n        \"magnitude\": return_value,\n        \"model\": model,\n    }\n\n\n  0%|          | 0/68 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]  4%|▍         | 3/68 [00:00&lt;00:02, 27.92it/s]  9%|▉         | 6/68 [00:00&lt;00:02, 27.39it/s] 13%|█▎        | 9/68 [00:00&lt;00:02, 26.60it/s] 18%|█▊        | 12/68 [00:00&lt;00:02, 27.43it/s] 22%|██▏       | 15/68 [00:00&lt;00:01, 27.04it/s] 26%|██▋       | 18/68 [00:00&lt;00:02, 24.68it/s] 32%|███▏      | 22/68 [00:00&lt;00:01, 26.20it/s] 37%|███▋      | 25/68 [00:00&lt;00:01, 26.85it/s] 41%|████      | 28/68 [00:01&lt;00:01, 27.47it/s] 46%|████▌     | 31/68 [00:01&lt;00:01, 27.66it/s] 50%|█████     | 34/68 [00:01&lt;00:01, 25.43it/s] 54%|█████▍    | 37/68 [00:01&lt;00:01, 25.42it/s] 60%|██████    | 41/68 [00:01&lt;00:00, 27.49it/s] 66%|██████▌   | 45/68 [00:01&lt;00:00, 29.20it/s] 72%|███████▏  | 49/68 [00:01&lt;00:00, 30.41it/s] 78%|███████▊  | 53/68 [00:01&lt;00:00, 28.54it/s] 84%|████████▍ | 57/68 [00:02&lt;00:00, 29.40it/s] 88%|████████▊ | 60/68 [00:02&lt;00:00, 29.30it/s] 94%|█████████▍| 64/68 [00:02&lt;00:00, 29.84it/s] 99%|█████████▊| 67/68 [00:02&lt;00:00, 29.79it/s]100%|██████████| 68/68 [00:02&lt;00:00, 27.94it/s]\n\n\n\nselected_counties = np.random.choice(county_names, 16)\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(8, 8), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nfor ax, county in zip(axs.flatten(), selected_counties):\n\n    ax = plot_fit_extreme_values(\n        ax=ax,\n        category=county,\n        model_names=[\"MLE_pyextreme\"],\n        models=models,\n        critical_magnitude=1.77,\n        critical_period=100,\n    )\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see the return periods can provide a substatially different profile depending on the county taken into consideration."

    "text": "1.5 Estimating Expected Extreme Values and Hail Events using Bayesian Regression\nLooking at Figure 1 we can hypothesize that the probability of observing a hail event of a certain magnitude can be a function of latitude and longitude. Indeed,the extreme hail events, although scattered, seem to show a certain degree of spatial consistency.\nSo why not simply empirically derive the likelihood of observing a given hail size in a given county? A bit like whe have been doing in Figure 2. As we can see, the empirical percentiles derived from the observed data are very dis-homogeneous. This is because they are strongly influenced by the data we have available for a given county. According to Figure 2 sample sizes can vary wildly from county to county and make the empirical estimate subject to the influence of outliers.\nIn this case what we would want to do is to pool information from the entire state for helping estimating a given percentile of hail size in each county, even in those were we observe a limited number of events. On top of that we would also want to smooth out the contribution of outliers. One option in this case could be to fit a regression model on latitude and longitude data so to be able to estimate the hail size for a given event. However, relying a conventional linear regression approach would not be appropriated in our case as:\n\nEstimating the mean as simple least square regression would do is not appropriate as in our case we would be interested in the tail of the distribution.\nAssuming the residuals are normally distributed, as it is the case in standard linear regression, does not hold in our case.\nLooking at Figure 1 we can see that if a relationship between latitude, longitude and hail size exists, it is certainly not linear.\nIn order to perform proper risk statements on estimate of hail size we need to be able to quantify uncertainty around our estimets.\nEstimating the size of hailstone for extreme events might only solve half of the problem. Since hail events per se are very rare it is also important to estimate their overall likelihood.\n\n\n\nShow supplementary code\nfrom scipy.stats import iqr\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer, OrdinalEncoder, MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\nfrom jax import random\n\nfrom numpyro.infer.reparam import LocScaleReparam\n\nfrom numpyro.distributions import (\n    Normal,\n    AsymmetricLaplaceQuantile,\n    HalfNormal,\n    HalfCauchy,\n    Distribution,\n    Laplace,\n)\nfrom numpyro.infer import MCMC, NUTS, Predictive, SVI, Trace_ELBO, RenyiELBO\nfrom numpyro.infer.svi import SVIRunResult\nfrom numpyro.infer.autoguide import (\n    AutoDAIS,\n    AutoNormal,\n    AutoLowRankMultivariateNormal,\n    AutoMultivariateNormal,\n)\n\nRNG_KEY = random.key(seed=666)\n\ndef sample_using_mcmc(\n    rng_key: ArrayLike,\n    model: Callable,\n    model_kwargs: Dict[str, Any],\n    MCMC_kwargs: Dict[str, Any],\n) -&gt;

Differently from conventional regression, quantile regression can be used for estimating any quantile in a distribution and not just the mean\n\n\n\nExample of Quantile Regression\n\n\nUsing a regression approach would allow us to include the type of spatial and temporal effect we outlined during oour exploratory data analysis. Generically the regression would have the following formulation:\n\\(\\mathcal{Q}_{y_i|X_i}(\\tau) = \\alpha + \\beta X_i\\)\nwith \\(\\tau\\) being the desired quantile, \\(X_i\\) all the spatio-temporal covariates associated with hail events \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) parameters to be estimated. A convenient choice of likelihood function for estimating $\\(\\mathcal{Q}_{y_i|X_i}(\\tau)\\) would be the asymetric laplace distribution . Expanding the formulation for quantile regression further, we would have\n\\(\\mathcal{AsymettricLaplace}(y; \\mu, \\tau) = \\alpha + \\phi(LatLon_i) \\beta_{LatLon} + \\phi(hour) \\beta_{Hour} + \\phi(month) \\beta_{month} + \\phi(year) \\beta_{year}\\)\nhere \\(\\phi\\) indicate a cubic spline function that we apply in order to model non-linearity in the contribution of the various covariates. More precisly, \\(\\phi(LatLon_i)\\) is a tensor-product spline generated from the latitude and longitude splines. \\(\\phi(hour)\\) and \\(\\phi(month)\\) can be thought as seasonal components while \\(\\phi(year)\\) can be identified as a trend component. In or case the only parameter to be estimated is \\(\\mu\\) that indicates the value of \\(y\\) at quantile \\(\\tau\\).\nIn order to perform estimation on the entire surface of Florida we opted for an approximation of the spatial covariates by doing the following:\n\nDividing the entire surface of Florida in a grid with 1 mile resolution (see Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The Estimation Grid Used for the Regression\n\n\n\n\nFor each square in the grid we obtain its centroid and extract the latitude, longitude and maximum observed hail size for that specific centroid obtaining something like the following table\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\nlongitude\nhail_size\n\n\n\n\nXXX\nYYY\nZ\n\n\nXXX\nYYY\nZ\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nWe retained all measurements associated with a given square so that a single square might have more than one hail event associated to it. It goes without saying that the spatial resolution of our regression here would be entirely determined by the size of the squares.\n\n\nShow supplementary code\ndef

In order to pool information across the entire state and performing outlier regularization we opted for a partially-pooled model (an amazing resource for learning more about this topic is this Michael Betancourt blog post).\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\n\\color{RedOrange}\\sigma_{county} \\sim HalfCauchy(\\sigma=5) \\\\\n\\color{RedOrange}\\mu_{county} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1)

covariates is multiplicative rather than additive.\nWe define the model in numpyro and visualize its graphical model representation\n\nreparam_config = {\n    \"alpha\":

pooled spatial model by allowing the spatial component to vary within each county. Although rather expensive (the model needs to estimate number_of_counties * number_spline_features parameters) this approach allows to have spatial effects that are localized to each county. This is an attempt to model the geographical peculiarities that each county might have.\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\n\\color{RedOrange}\\sigma_{county} \\sim HalfCauchy(\\sigma=5)

heterogenous across counties. Although this is the effect we wanted to achieve, some of the sharp variation at counties’ edges do not look very natural. This is a desirable effect when environmental conditions justify this behaviour (e.g., the presence of mountains or terrain depressions) but it might also be due to the fact that we did not put any constraint forcing coninuity between contiguous boundaries.\n\nvisualize_geo_regression(\n    covariates_hat_df=quantile_regression_covariates_hat_df,\n    posterior=posterior_hierarchical_quantile_regression_svi,\n    parameter=\"spatial_component\",\n    parameter_transformer=lambda x: jnp.exp(x),\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig, axs = visualize_temporal_components(\n    temporal_components=generate_temporal_components(\n        posterior=posterior_pooled_quantile_regression_svi,\n        transformers=quantile_regression_transformers,\n        years=continuous_state_modelling_df[YEAR_COVARIATES].unique(),\n        parameter_transformer=lambda x: jnp.exp(x),\n    )\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Estimating the Likelyhood of Hail Events Using Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression\nA potential solution for estimating the overall likelyhood and quantity of hail events would be to use a zero-inflated negative-binomial regression.\nDifferently from the quantile regression in this case we did not model the spatial component as it would have been too cumbersome to enumerate all the possible occurencies of non-hail over space and time. We limited at modelling only the temporal component and using a hierarchcical intercept for modelling variations across counties.\nThe zero-inflated negative binomial likelihood used in this regression is a mixture of a discrete component provided by a negative binomial regression and a gate component provided by a logistic regression. The first models the observed number of hail events while the second defines the overall likelihood of a hail event to happen (we suggest consulting the lecture on mixtures from Richard McElreath statistical rethinking course for a more precise discussion on the topic.)\n\n\nShow supplementary code\ndef create_estimation_covariates_zero_inflated_regression(\n

What our agent is interested in then is the true value \\(q*\\) of taking an action \\(a\\) and selecting a given arm \\(k\\), the action associated with highest value should be the go-to strategy for maximizing the cumulative payoff\nSince the true value is not known, our agent often has to rely on an estimate of such value which comes with an associated level of uncertainty. We can think of this in terms of the relationship between the mean of the distribution from which the rewards of a given arm are sampled and its empirical estimate with associated standard error.\nSelecting the best set of actions over a finite number of interactions then requires a balance between and exploitative and explorative behaviour\n\nExploit the options with the highest associated estimated reward\nAllow the exploration of other options in case our exploitative behaviour has been biased by noisy estimates."

This means that as a measure of value for a given action, we are interested in\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[r | K=k]\\)\nIn a contextual multi-amred bandit scenario instead, the payoff of a given action is dependent on the context in which the action is performed. This implies that given a matrix of context vectors \\(X_{K\\times h}\\) we try to estimate the value of a given action as\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[r | K=k, X=x_k]\\)\nIn order to get a better understanding of what we mean here, let’s simulate a potential generating process that could give rise to data suitable for a contextual multi-armed bandit problem.\n\n2.2.1 Create the Simulation Dataset\nWe will approximate the data generating process using sklearn’s make_classification function.

    "section": "2.3 LinUCB Algorithm for a Multi-Armed Bandit Problem",
    "text": "2.3 LinUCB Algorithm for a Multi-Armed Bandit Problem\nTo solve a multi-armed bandit problem with context we can leverage an algorithm called Linear Upper Confidence Bound [li2010contextual] (i.e. LinUCB).\nThe aim of the algorithm is to progressively obtain a reliable estimate of all the options provided by the multi-armed bandit and to do so efficiently (i.e. with the smallest number of interactions.)\nFor doing so LinUCB simply fit a multinomial regression to the context (i.e. the covariates) provided by each arm of the bandit in order to estimate the return value associated with each arm, more formally\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[r_{t,k} | x_k] = x^\\intercal \\theta^*_k\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta^*_k\\) are the set of parameters associated with a given arm \\(k\\) for which the algorithm is trying to find the optimal estimate. Here we assume \\(x_k\\) to be invariant across all \\(t \\in T\\) but that is not always the case.\nAs the number of covariates can be large we cannot know a-priori if all of them are informative or if they are collinear. For this reason LinUCB rely on a form of regularized regression called Ridge Regression. Moreover since we don’t have a dataset to fit this model on but rather we refine the estimate for \\(\\theta^*_k\\) as we interact with the arms \\(K\\), LinUCB utilizes what is called online learning for obtaining estimates of each interaction as given by\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\n\\mathbb{A}_k = \\mathbb{X}_k^\\intercal \\mathbb{X_k} + \\mathbb{I}_d\\\\\n\\hat{\\theta_k} = \\mathbb{A}^{-1}\\mathbb{X}_k^\\intercal r_k\n\\end{gather}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{X}_k\\) is the design matrix \\(m \\times d\\) where \\(m\\) is the number of contexts (i.e., training inputs) and \\(d\\) the dimensionality of each context (i.e., the number of covariates considered). Here \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) is the \\(d\\times d\\) identity matrix and \\(r_k\\) is the corresponding \\(m\\)-dimensional reward (or response) vector. The identity matrix (which is usually expressed with a scaling factor \\(\\lambda\\) here implicitly set to 1.) act as a constrain on the parameter \\(\\theta_k\\).\nThe advantages of relying on the Ridge regression is that we can interpret \\(\\hat{\\theta_k}\\) a the mean of the Bayesian posterior of the parameter estimate and \\(\\mathbb{A}_k^-1\\) its covariance. In this way we can compute the expectation for \\(r_{t, k}\\) as in Equation 1 and with it its associated standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{x_k^\\intercal \\mathbb{A_k}^{-1}x_k}\\) which is proven to be a reasonable tight bound.\nBased on this assumption then at any step \\(t\\) we can select the appropriate arm \\(k\\) to be\n\\(k_t = \\arg \\max_{k_t \\in K_t}(x^\\intercal \\hat{\\theta}_k + \\alpha \\sqrt{x_k^\\intercal \\mathbb{A_k}^{-1}x_k})\\)\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) becomes a constant that controls the exploration vs exploitation behaviour of the algorithm. Indeed, we can think of this as taking the value sitting at \\(\\alpha\\) standard deviation at the right of the mean of a gaussian as most optimistic retun value when picking a certain arm. Larger values of \\(\\alpha\\) will therefore encourage to select arms with highest UCB even if the return is much more uncertain (as the UCB lies far away from the expected value).\nThe positive aspect of this is that the more an arm get selected the tighter it’s confidence bound become, up to a point in which it will become more promising to explore arms that provides larger UCB by the fact that they have simply been explored less."

Let’ s see how this expression would look like\n\nimport jax \nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef my_foo(x):\n    x_1 = x\n    x_2 = jnp.square(x)\n    x_3 = jnp.power(x, 3)\n    out = x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n    return out\n\nprint(jax.make_jaxpr(my_foo)(3.0))\n\n{ lambda ; a:f32[]. let\n    b:f32[] = square a\n    c:f32[] = integer_pow[y=3] a\n    d:f32[] = add a b\n    e:f32[] = add d c\n  in (e,) }\n\n\nas we can see our variables have now an explicit type (f32) and the functions jnp.square and jnp.power have been replaced by the lax equivalent integer_pow. lax can be thought as a sort of JAX low-level back-end. This expression will be then sent to the XLA compiler for being transformed in efficient machine code.\nBut what happens to our jax expression if we try to poke one of JAX sharp edges? Let’s introduce a side effect in our function and see\n\nimport jax \nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\naccumulator = [] # global variable\n\ndef my_foo_with_side_effect(x):\n    x_1 = x\n    x_2 = jnp.square(x)\n    x_3 = jnp.power(x, 3)\n    out = x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n    accumulator.append(jnp.power(out, 2)) # side effect\n    return out\n\nprint(jax.make_jaxpr(my_foo_with_side_effect)(3.0))\n\n{ lambda ; a:f32[]. let\n    b:f32[] = square a\n    c:f32[] = integer_pow[y=3] a\n    d:f32[] = add a b\n    e:f32[] = add d c\n    _:f32[] = integer_pow[y=2] e\n  in (e,) }\n\n\nas we can see our accumulator variable is not tracked in the jax expression neither are its associated computations! They will not be tracked by the compiler nor retrieved when the cached version of foo is executed a second time.\nWe know that most JAX functionalities (e.g. computing gradients) are achieved by applying the appropriated transformations to the functions of interest. These transformed functions will go down the same route of being translated into the relevant jax expression and compiled by XLA. Let’s unravel what the gradient of foo would look like\n\nfrom jax import grad\n\ngrad_my_foo = grad(my_foo) # we derive the gradient function of my_foo\n\nprint(jax.make_jaxpr(grad_my_foo)(3.0))\n\n{ lambda ; a:f32[]. let\n    b:f32[] = square a\n    c:f32[] = mul 2.0 a\n    d:f32[] = integer_pow[y=3] a\n    e:f32[] = integer_pow[y=2] a\n    f:f32[] = mul 3.0 e\n    g:f32[] = add a b\n    _:f32[] = add g d\n    h:f32[] = mul 1.0 f\n    i:f32[] = add_any h 1.0\n    j:f32[] = mul 1.0 c\n    k:f32[] = add_any i j\n  in (k,) }\n\n\nWe can see how the derived jax expression now tracks all the required computations for computing the gradient pf my_foo with respect to its input x. We will expand more on the grad function later on this post. Let’s move now to another very important feature of JAX: random number generation.\n\n\n2 ARRRRGH!!!! explicit PRNG states\nGenerate random numbers using numpy it is a relatively straightforward matter:\n\nx_1 = np.random.normal() # numpy is both easy...\nprint(x_1)\n\nx_2 = np.random.normal() # ...and intuitive!\nprint(x_1 == x_2)\n\n1.0415928805928754\nFalse\n\n\nunder the hood numpy will do alot of wizardry for us implicitly setting the state of the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) every time we ask to simulate sampling from a given distribution (e.g. uniform, normal etc…). With JAX we must do a bit more work as the library requires to explicitly pass a state whenever we call the PRNG\n\nfrom jax import random\n\n# jax is less easy\nmaster_key = random.PRNGKey(666) # set the state with a seed\nprint(f\"Key {master_key}\")\nrandom.normal(key=master_key) # sample from the standard normal\n\nKey [  0 666]\n\n\nArray(-0.10761635, dtype=float32)\n\n\nthis implies that the numbers are deterministically generated at random given a certain state. Hence if we do not make sure to generate fresh new states whenever we require a new random behaviour we might incur in some rather nasty side effects\n\naccumulator = 0\nfor _ in range(100):\n\n    x_1 = random.normal(key=master_key) # generate two numbers using the same state\n    x_2 = random.normal(key=master_key)\n    accumulator += int(x_1 == x_2)\n\nprint(accumulator)\n\n100\n\n\nWithout modifying the state, calling random.normal will always generate the exact same sequence of random numbers! What we need to do in this case is to leverage the split function in the random module for splitting the original state (or key) in one or more sub-states (or sub-keys)\n\naccumulator = 0\nseed_key = master_key\nfor _ in range(100):\n\n    seed_key, consume_key_1, consume_key_2 = random.split(seed_key, 3) # one key always left for generation\n    x_1 = random.normal(key=consume_key_1) # generate two numbers using different states\n    x_2 = random.normal(key=consume_key_2)\n    accumulator += int(x_1 == x_2)\n\nprint(accumulator)\n\n0\n\n\ndespite this behaviour might look as a big annoyance at first, it offers us a greater degree on control of when and where we want to see randomness.\n\n\n3 Just In Time Compilation\nOne of the advantages of JAX is its ability to Just In Time (JIT) compile python code to different types of accelerating devices, be them CPU, GPU or TPU. By compiling and caching slow python code to optimized machine code. So let’s see a simple example\n\ndef silly_expensive_loopy_function(x):\n    \"\"\"A silly function, it does many completely useless computations.\n    However it is very loopy and expensive.\n    \n    Args:\n        x  (float): starting point of the silly function\n        \n    Returns:\n        x (float): output of the silly function\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):    \n            for k in range(10): \n                x += i + j + k + i*j + j*k + j**2 + k**2\n    return x\n\nprint(\"Pure Python\")\n%timeit silly_expensive_loopy_function(10.)\n\nPure Python\n54.7 μs ± 202 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n\n\nas we can see we have a quite hefty execution time, but what happens if we JIT compile our function through the relevant JAX transformation?\n\nfrom jax import jit\n\njitted_silly_expensive_loopy_function = jit(silly_expensive_loopy_function)\n\nprint(\"Jitted Python with Compilation Time\")\n%timeit jitted_silly_expensive_loopy_function(10.).block_until_ready()\n\nJitted Python with Compilation Time\n3.06 μs ± 42 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\n\n\nas we can see execution time is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower for the JIT compiled function. The function of .block_until_ready() is to time not just compilation but also computation.\nIf compilation time can be avoided, through caching for example, we can achieve even further speed-up. This because once a piece of potentially slow python code is compiled and cached by JAX, it can be skipped altogether for subsequent computations.\n\njitted_silly_expensive_loopy_function(10.).block_until_ready()\n\nprint(\"Jitted Python without Compilation Time\")\n%timeit jitted_silly_expensive_loopy_function(666.).block_until_ready()\n\nJitted Python without Compilation Time\n3.05 μs ± 11.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n\n4 Looping vs Scanning\nJIT compilation is a great way for optimizing our potentially slow python code, however it comes with few gotchas and looping is one of them. If we have a function executing some relatively demanding computations over a long sequence\n\nstart_x_est=160.\ndx=1.\nh=1./10.\ng=.5/3.\ndt=1.\n\nX = 160. + (jnp.arange(1, 51) * 1.) + random.normal(shape=(50, ), key=master_key)\n\n@jit\ndef step(carry, x):\n    \"\"\" Step function for the g-h filter\n\n    Args:\n        carry (tupler): values to be carried over\n        x (float): data\n\n    Returns:\n        carry (tuple): updated components\n        x_est_update (float): updated estimate for the state\n    \"\"\"\n    previous_x_est, dx, h, g, dt = carry # h, g, and dt are fixed parameters\n    \n    x_pred = previous_x_est + (dx * dt) # system dynamics\n\n    residual = x - x_pred\n    dx = dx + h * (residual) / dt\n    updated_x_est = x_pred + g * residual\n    \n    return (updated_x_est, dx, h, g, dt ), updated_x_est\n\nfor example, the above function illustrates the computations used by a gh-filter. This function is supposed to\n\nStep over a signal\nGenerate an estimate of the state underlying the signal. This is given by a clever combination of the previous estimate and the current observed signal.\nFinally, provide the current estimate along with other relative parameters needed in the next step.\n\nIn this case, the most straightforward way to move the step function over the signal would be using a for loop\n\n@jit\ndef loopy_function(X, start_x_est, dx, h, g, dt=1.):\n    \"\"\"Gh filter logic implmented with for loop\n\n    Args:\n        X (Device Array): Input data\n        start_x_est (float): Start values for the estimated state\n        dx (float): Rate of change in the system dynamics\n        h (float): Update value\n        g (float): Gain value\n        dt (float): Frequency \n\n    Returns:\n        output (Device Array): Estimate state value\n    \"\"\"\n    output = []\n    carry = (start_x_est, dx, h, g, dt)\n    for x in X:\n        \n        carry, yhat = step(carry=carry, x=x)\n        output.append(yhat)\n    \n    return jnp.array(output)\n\nprint(\"Jitted for loop\")\n%timeit loopy_function(X=X, start_x_est=start_x_est, dx=dx, h=h, g=g, dt=dt).block_until_ready()\n\nJitted for loop\n40 μs ± 7.2 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\nJIT compiling both our function gives us a convenient speedup as we have seen before. But what happens if we increase the length of the signal over which we want to step?\n\nX = 160. + (jnp.arange(1, 101) * 1.) + random.normal(shape=(100, ), key=master_key)\n\nprint(\"Jitted for loop over a long sequence\")\n%timeit loopy_function(X=X, start_x_est=start_x_est, dx=dx, h=h, g=g, dt=dt).block_until_ready()\n\nJitted for loop over a long sequence\n70.3 μs ± 12.4 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\nthat is a considerable increase in computational time which doesn’t seem to increase linearly with the number of steps in our signal. What is happening under the hood is that XLA has to unroll all the computations included in our for loop in order to compile them, would our signal be much longer we would wait until the end of times for the compiler to do its job.\nThankfully, JAX offers a solution to this through its the lower-level API lax using scan.\n\nfrom jax.lax import scan\n\n@jit\ndef scan_function(X, start_x_est, dx, h, g, dt=1.):\n    \"\"\"Gh filter logic implemented with lax scan\n\n    Args:\n        X (Device Array): Input data\n        start_x_est (float): Start values for the estimated state\n        dx (float): Rate of change in the system dynamics\n        h (float): Update value\n        g (float): Gain value\n        dt (float): Frequency \n\n    Returns:\n        output (Device Array): Estimate state value\n    \"\"\"\n    carry, output= scan(\n        step, # this function is going to be moved along the input series,\n        (start_x_est, dx, h, g, dt), # these are the initial values of the carry,\n        X # this is the series over which step is moved\n    )\n    return output\n\nthe syntax of scan might looks a bit un-intuitive if you are used to for loops but it is actually quite simple. It will iterate our step function over all the values of X and compute both the output relative to the current value of X and a carry. As the name suggests the carry will carry over any information that might be required by step in the future, be those parameters or computed values. In our example the carry is made of fixed parameters and state variables computed inside step. But let’s look at a quick perfromance benchmark now\n\n\nShow supplementary code\nscan_timings = []\nloop_timings = []\nfor length in [10, 20, 40, 80, 100]:\n\n    X = (\n        160. + \n        (jnp.arange(1, length+1) * 1.) + \n        (random.normal(shape=(length, ), key=master_key) * 10)\n    )\n\n    kwargs = {\n        \"X\": X,\n        \"start_x_est\": start_x_est, \n        \"dx\": dx, \n        \"h\": h, \n        \"g\": g, \n        \"dt\": dt\n    }\n\n    loopy_result = %timeit -o -n300 loopy_function(**kwargs).block_until_ready()\n    scan_result = %timeit -o -n300 scan_function(**kwargs).block_until_ready()\n\n    scan_timings.append(\n        scan_result.best\n    )\n    loop_timings.append(\n        loopy_result.best\n    )\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(6, 3))\nax.plot(\n    [10, 20, 40, 80, 100],\n    loop_timings,\n    label=\"For Loop\"\n)\nax.plot(\n    [10, 20, 40, 80, 100],\n    scan_timings,\n    label=\"Scan\"\n)\nax.legend()\nax.set_xlabel(\"Input Legth\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Compilation + Execution Time\\nSeconds\")\nplt.show()\n\n\nThe slowest run took 14.66 times longer than the fastest.

Lets’s look at the result of our scanned function now\n\n\nShow supplementary code\nyhat = scan_function(\n    X=X, \n    start_x_est=start_x_est, \n    dx=dx, \n    h=h, \n    g=g, \n    dt=dt\n)\n\nax = visualize_univariate_time_series(\n    time_series=X,\n    label=\"Data\"\n)\n\nax = visualize_univariate_time_series(\n    time_series=yhat,\n    ax=ax,\n    label=\"State Estimate\"\n)\nax.plot(\n    np.arange(1, 101),\n    160. + (jnp.arange(1, 101) * 1.),\n    linestyle=\"--\",\n    c=\"k\",\n    alpha=0.5,\n    label=\"System\"\n)\nax.legend()\nax.set_xlabel(\"Time\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Value\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall seems to be in order and executed in record time!\n\n\n5 Computing Gradients\nLet’s come now to the other central transformation offered by JAX: grad. With grad we can transform python functions in gradient functions, what do we mean by this? Let’s take the square function as an example\n\ndef square(x):\n    \"\"\"Return the square of x\n    \n    Args:\n        x  (float): values to be squared\n        \n    Returns:\n        ssq_ (float): square of x\n    \"\"\"\n    sq_ = x ** 2\n    return sq_\n\ndx = grad(square)\n\nby passing this function to the grad transformation, we can obtain a new function that will evaluate the gradient of x with respect to sq_ for us, pretty convenient.\n\n\nShow supplementary code\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4), sharex=True)\nfor x in np.linspace(-10, 10, 100):\n\n    axs[0].scatter(\n        x, \n        square(x),\n        s=1,\n        c=\"k\"\n    )\n    axs[1].scatter(\n        x, \n        dx(x),\n        s=1,\n        c=\"r\"\n    )\n\nfor ax in axs:\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"$x^2$\")\naxs[1].set_ylabel(\"$\\dfrac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x}$\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;&gt;:21: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\d'\n&lt;&gt;:21: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\d'\n/var/folders/h_/lq2hvf816xs9ffng6570sblh0000gn/T/ipykernel_3597/2664859271.py:21: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\d'\n  axs[1].set_ylabel(\"$\\dfrac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x}$\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining the derivative of a single variable function however is not that impressive, scipy.optimize.approx_fprime can easily achieve the same result although with a slightly more laborious approach. So is the advantage of grad only to provide some syntactic sugar? Well, not really.\n\nDifferently from scipy.optimize.approx_fprime which relies on finite difference for approximating gradients, grad leverages automatic differentiation for obtaining more numerically stable results.\nThe use of automatic differentiation allows us to compute gradients of very complex and composite functions.\nThe syntactic sugar capabilities of grad allow us to customize which gradients we are interested to and to compute them with respect to many different data structures.\n\nLet’s look at the two variables function sum_of_squares\n\ndef sum_of_squares(x_1, x_2):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of squares of x_1 and x_2\n    \n    Args:\n        x_1  (float): first variable to be squared\n        x_2  (float): second variable to be squared\n        \n    Returns:\n        ssq_ (float): square of x\n    \"\"\"\n    ssq_ = jnp.square(x_1) + jnp.square(x_2)\n    return ssq_\n\ndxx = grad(sum_of_squares, argnums=[0, 1])\n\nIn this case sum_of_squares takes two variables as inputs so we have to specify for which one we want to compute the partial derivative, we do that using the argnums argument.

The only requirement is that such data structure is in the form of a Pytree. A Pytree is a “…a tree-like structure built out of container-like Python objects…”, it usually have the following form\npytree\n|\n|_node_1\n|      |_leaf_1.1\n|      |_leaf_1.2\n|\n|_node_2\n|      |_leaf_2.1\n|      |_leaf_2.2\n|      |_node_2.1\n|               |_leaf_2.1.1\n|               |_...\n|\n|_...                \neach node and leaf can by default be any python data structures among lists, tuples and dicts however JAX allows to register others as valid pytree. The tree-like structure offers a great deal of flexibility for specifying things like the parameters of a model. Let’s see a concrete example with a linear regression\n\nfrom jax import value_and_grad\n\nX = random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(1000, 40))\ny = random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(1000,))\n\n# a dictionary as a pytree with 2 nodes and 41 leaves\nmy_parameters = {\n    \"alpha\": random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(1,)), \n    \"beta\": random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(X.shape[1],))\n}\n\nonce we have defined our parameters, we can pass them to an appropriate function and let grad do its magic for deriving the gradient.\n\n@jit\ndef sum_of_squared_errors(y, yhat):\n    \"\"\"Return the square of x\n    \n    Args:\n        y  (DeviceArray): ground truth values\n        yhat  (DeviceArray): model predictions\n        \n    Returns:\n        ssq (float): sum of the squares of the difference between y and yhat.\n    \"\"\"\n    return jnp.sum(jnp.square(y - yhat))\n\n@jit\ndef linear_regression_loss(X, y, parameters):\n    \"\"\"Compute the loss,  sum_of_squared_errors, for a linear regression model.\n\n    Args:\n        X  (DeviceArray): model covariates.\n        y  (DeviceArray): ground truth values.\n        parameters (dictionary): model's parameters.\n        \n    Returns:\n        loss (float): loss for the linear regression model.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    yhat = jnp.dot(X, parameters[\"beta\"]) + parameters[\"alpha\"]\n    loss = sum_of_squared_errors(y=y, yhat=yhat)\n    return loss\n\nlinear_regression_grad = value_and_grad(\n    fun=linear_regression_loss,\n    argnums=2 # w.r.t. parameters\n)\n\nin this case we used a variation of grad named value_and_grad that returns not just the gradient but also the output of the function, which in this case is whatever comes out of sum_of_squared_errors.\nThe covenience of grad (and its variations) is that it will return the partial derivates of our parameters with respect to the output of sum_of_squared_errors keeping the same pytree structure!\n\nsse, gradients = linear_regression_grad(X, y, my_parameters)\n\ngrad_alpha = gradients['alpha']\ngrad_beta = gradients['beta']\n\nprint(f\"SSE: {sse}\")\nprint(f\"Partial Derivative alpha: {grad_alpha}\")\nprint(f\"Partial Derivatives beta: {grad_beta}\")\n\nSSE: 53050.79296875\nPartial Derivative alpha: [-478.6121]\nPartial Derivatives beta: [  280.32477   272.2938   7183.9194   1950.6066  -2001.7474  -1227.3281\n   520.00366  1380.3948   1599.383    -864.306   -2723.1323   2912.9316\n  2502.141     300.33267   818.23303  1697.8423  -2095.8745   4386.4863\n  1800.3965    320.25903 -1798.7013   1561.4841  -2179.1855  -1486.0132\n  1934.0378   1267.4854  -4054.1572   -267.9964   1781.633    1066.2424\n  1163.5311    385.65964  -921.5457   1163.6954  -2004.7834   3002.1978\n  2724.7102  -2948.397   -4152.8105   3641.4666 ]\n\n\nThis behaviour is extensible to virtually any python object as far as it is registered as a pytree. So how can we register a python object as a pytree? Let’s take a NamedTuple as an example\n\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nLinearRegressionParameters = namedtuple(\n    \"LinearRegressionParameters\", \n    [\"alpha\", \"beta\"]\n)\n\nwhen we register a pytree we have to tell JAX how to unpack the leaves into an iterable and pack them back in the original tree structure\n\nfrom jax.tree_util import register_pytree_node\n\nregister_pytree_node(\n    LinearRegressionParameters,\n    lambda xs: (tuple(xs), None),  # tell JAX how to unpack to an iterable\n    lambda _, xs: LinearRegressionParameters(*xs)       # tell JAX how to pack back into LinearRegressionPArameters\n)\n\nwe now just need to modify our linear_regression_loss function slightly in order to use the LinearRegressionParameters instead of a dictionary.\n\n@jit\ndef linear_regression_loss(X, y, parameters):\n    \"\"\"Compute the loss,  sum_of_squared_errors, for a linear regression model.\n\n    Args:\n        X  (DeviceArray): model covariates.\n        y  (DeviceArray): ground truth values.\n        parameters (NamedTuple): model's parameters.\n        \n    Returns:\n        loass (float): loss for the linear regression model.\n    \"\"\"\n    yhat = jnp.dot(X, parameters.beta) + parameters.alpha\n    loss = sum_of_squared_errors(y=y, yhat=yhat)\n    return loss\n\nlinear_regression_grad = value_and_grad(\n    fun=linear_regression_loss,\n    argnums=2\n)\n\nmy_parameters = LinearRegressionParameters(\n    random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(1,)),\n    random.normal(key=master_key, shape=(X.shape[1],))\n)\n\nsse, gradients = linear_regression_grad(X, y, my_parameters)\n\ngrad_alpha = gradients.alpha\ngrad_beta = gradients.beta\n\nprint(f\"SSE: {sse}\")\nprint(f\"Partial Derivative alpha: {grad_alpha}\")\nprint(f\"Partial Derivatives beta: {grad_beta}\")\n\nSSE: 53050.79296875\nPartial Derivative alpha: [-478.6121]\nPartial Derivatives beta: [  280.32477   272.2938   7183.9194   1950.6066  -2001.7474  -1227.3281\n   520.00366  1380.3948   1599.383    -864.306   -2723.1323   2912.9316\n  2502.141     300.33267   818.23303  1697.8423  -2095.8745   4386.4863\n  1800.3965    320.25903 -1798.7013   1561.4841  -2179.1855  -1486.0132\n  1934.0378   1267.4854  -4054.1572   -267.9964   1781.633    1066.2424\n  1163.5311    385.65964  -921.5457   1163.6954  -2004.7834   3002.1978\n  2724.7102  -2948.397   -4152.8105   3641.4666 ]\n\n\nHere we conclude this first introductory post on the basics of JAX. We want to stress that this is just a small selection of the features offered by JAX.\nWe can think of it as a distillation of some of the contents reported in the JAX online documentation\nThat said, what we outlined so far should equip us with enough knowledge to develop some simple models in the next posts.\n\n\n6 Hardware and Requirements\nHere you can find the hardware and python requirements used for building this post.\n\n%watermark\n\nLast updated: 2025-03-28T09:22:09.149860+00:00\n\nPython implementation: CPython\nPython version       : 3.13.2\nIPython version      : 9.0.2\n\nCompiler    : Clang 18.1.8 \nOS          : Darwin\nRelease     : 24.3.0\nMachine     : arm64\nProcessor   : arm\nCPU cores   : 14\nArchitecture: 64bit\n\n\n\n\n%watermark --iversions\n\nnumpy     : 2.2.4\njax       : 0.5.2\nmatplotlib: 3.10.1"
