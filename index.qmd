# About me

::: {.justify}
I'm Valerio Bonometti, a data scientist working at [Tesco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco), with experience in both forecasting and recommender systems. 

Prior to that, I completed an industrial PhD in computer science at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) while being based **full-time**
with [Square Enix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix) data science team for 4 years. My PhD thesis attempted to bridge neuroscintific theories
of motivation with machine learning approaches for its estimation. The focus was on designing, developing and  prototyping artificial neural network models 
for estimating the motivational state of  players and predicting their engagement simulatenously across a wide range of games.

My educational background is in (clinical) experimental psychology and neuroscience and I have a keen interest in applied statistics, machine learning and 
science in general.
